                  <p>The Marvel Avengers are a group of superheroes brought together by the secret organization S.H.I.E.L.D. to defend Earth from extraordinary threats. The team, often referred to as "Earth's Mightiest Heroes," was initially formed to combat Loki and his Chitauri army, and has since faced countless adversaries, including extraterrestrial invasions, rogue A.I., and even internal conflicts.</p>
